Monthly data was hand entered into Total Discharges.xlsx file as
the tab "Monthly Discharge Data", following notes from Greg Wood on
the PDF data sheets.

That data was aggregated to annual totals, in the R Notebook
"Wastewater Discharge Data 2016-2018.Rmd".  The "annualdata"
dataframe was hand copied back into the Excel spreadsheet as the
basis for the "Annual Discharges" tab.
