Our focus was on major WWTF discharges and other POTW.  We also did a 
quick scan for any direct discharges to the Bay from our coastal towns.
This search uncovered a Brunswick subsurface discharge to Lands End, 
which may deserve additional consideration, as it could leach 
nutrients to the adjacent Bay.

Note also that the Sebasco discharge appears to also be listed as an OBD.  
This suggests the two lists may not be independent of each other.
